# Todo App with Local Storage & Confetti Celebration ðŸŽ‰

This project is a simple **Todo App** built with JavaScript that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. It stores tasks locally using **Local Storage** to persist data between sessions. The app also features a colorful task interface, progress tracking, and a fun confetti animation when all tasks are completed.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Users can add tasks with custom background colors.
- **Edit Existing Tasks**: Tasks can be modified by clicking the edit icon.
- **Delete Tasks**: Tasks can be deleted individually using the delete icon.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Users can mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox next to the task.
- **Progress Bar**: Tracks the number of completed tasks out of the total tasks.
- **Confetti Celebration**: A confetti animation appears when all tasks are marked as complete.

## How it Works

1. **Task Storage**: Tasks are stored in the browser's Local Storage, ensuring data is retained between page refreshes.
2. **Dynamic Task List**: The task list is dynamically updated based on user actions, with real-time feedback.
3. **Progress Tracking**: A progress bar at the top of the page shows the percentage of completed tasks.
4. **Confetti**: When all tasks are completed, a confetti animation is triggered to celebrate the user's achievement.
